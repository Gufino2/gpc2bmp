# gpc2bmp

This tool converts GPC graphics files to regular BMP files. GPC is a graphic file format used in some PC98 games from FairyTale.
Years ago I stumbled across this interesting PC98 game called "Necronomicon": basically it's a Lovecraft-inspired horror visual novel with 90's anime style graphics. The game was japanese-only (I guess it was never released outside Japan) and there was no fan translation available, so I decided to "take a look inside the game engine" and try to create some translation tools. I reversed a big chunk of the game engine, wrote some basic tools but real life took over, and the project was left dormant, in the depths of one of my hard drives.

Years passed. A few days ago [Damiano Gerli](https://twitter.com/damgentemp) tweeted about "Necronomicon": he was intersted in the game but there was no fan translation yet, so I decided to dig through my old sources in order to find, update, polish and release my old tools.

**gpc2bmp** is the first one, more will come (hopefully).
